# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the python code and documentation for analyzing the "Iris" dataset using
 Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to restaurant bills and tips,
 including total bill amount, tip amount, customer gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size. 
Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.
## Dataset Description
The "Iris" dataset contains information about restaurant bills and tips. Each entry represents a unique 
dining experience and includes the following columns:

- **total_bill**: Represents the total bill amount in a restaurant setting.
- **sepal_length**: Denotes the length of the sepal (a part of the flower) in centimeters
- **sepal_width**: Indicates the width of the sepal in centimeters.		
- **petal_length**: Specifies the length of the petal (another part of the flower) in centimeters.
- **petal_width**:Represents the width of the petal in centimeters.		.
- **species**:  Classifies the species of iris flowers into three categories: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
